[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findoxbot_config.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "oxbot_config", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "oxbot_config" with
  any of the following names:

    oxbot_configConfig.cmake
    oxbot_config-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "oxbot_config" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "oxbot_config_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "oxbot_config" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
